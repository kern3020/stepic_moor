Wigglesworthia glossinidia
==========================

Wigglesworthia glossinidia is the organism for our investigation. It
has coevolved with the tsetse fly. Because of this symbiotic
relationship, it has lost parts of its genome and is famously tiny
genome (roughly 700000bp). You can download the genomic data [here]
